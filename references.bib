	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a thermodynamically consistent four-species model of tumor growth based on the continuum theory of mixtures. Unique to this model is the incorporation of nutrient within the mixture as opposed to being modeled with an auxiliary reaction-diﬀusion equation. The formulation involves systems of highly nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations of surface eﬀects through diﬀuse-interface models. A mixed ﬁnite element spatial discretization is developed and implemented to provide numerical results demonstrating the range of solutions this model can produce. A time-stepping algorithm is then presented for this system which is shown to be ﬁrst order accurate and energy-gradient stable. The results of an array of numerical experiments are presented that demonstrate a wide range of solutions produced by various choices of model parameters.},

	abstract = {The design of numerical approximations of the Cahn-Hilliard model preserving the maximum principle is a challenging problem, even more if considering additional transport terms. In this work, we present a new upwind discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the convective Cahn-Hilliard model with degenerate mobility which preserves the maximum principle and prevents non-physical spurious oscillations. Furthermore, we show some numerical experiments in agreement with the previous theoretical results. Finally, numerical comparisons with other schemes found in the literature are also carried out.},
